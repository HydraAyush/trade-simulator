# Cryptocurrency Market Data System - Presentation Script

## 1. Introduction [30-45 seconds]

Hello everyone! Today I'm going to walk you through our Cryptocurrency Market Data System. This project is a real-time market data aggregator and simulator that connects to cryptocurrency exchanges, specifically OKX, and provides market data through a modern web interface. The system is built with scalability and reliability in mind, featuring both live exchange data and fallback simulation capabilities.

## 2. System Architecture [1-2 minutes]

### Backend Components
- FastAPI server for REST API and WebSocket connections
- MongoDB database for data persistence
- Real-time WebSocket connection to OKX exchange
- Market data simulation module for fallback scenarios

### Key Features
- Real-time market data streaming
- Automatic failover to simulation mode
- Historical data storage and retrieval
- Trade and orderbook data processing
- VPN and proxy support for reliable connectivity

## 3. Data Flow [1-2 minutes]

### Market Data Collection
- Direct WebSocket connection to OKX exchange
- Reception of real-time trades and ticker data
- Automatic handling of connection issues
- Fallback to simulation mode if needed

### Data Processing
- Standardization of data format
- Timestamp normalization
- Price and size formatting
- Order book aggregation

### Data Storage
- MongoDB collections for different data types:
  * Market data snapshots
  * Individual trades
  * Orderbook states
- Structured format with exchange and symbol information

## 4. Code Deep Dive [2-3 minutes]

### WebSocket Handler (market_data.py)
- Manages connection to OKX
- Handles data processing
- Implements simulation mode
- Manages client connections

### Database Layer (database.py)
- MongoDB integration
- Data formatting and storage
- Structured data model with:
  * Timestamps in ISO 8601 format
  * String-formatted numerical values
  * Consistent schema across collections

### API Layer (app.py)
- FastAPI implementation
- WebSocket endpoints
- REST API endpoints for historical data
- Health monitoring

## 5. Error Handling and Reliability [1-2 minutes]

### Connection Management
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- VPN and proxy support
- Simulation mode fallback

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Graceful degradation
- Client connection management
- Data validation and sanitization

## 6. Demo [2-3 minutes]

### Starting the Application
```bash
# Initialize the server
python app.py

# Expected output:
INFO:     Started server process [xxxxx]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:database:Connected to MongoDB
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Real-time Data Flow
```json
// Example of stored market data
{
    "timestamp": "2025-05-04T10:39:13Z",
    "exchange": "OKX",
    "symbol": "BTC-USDT-SWAP",
    "asks": [
        ["95445.5", "9.06"],
        ["95448", "2.05"]
    ]
}
```

### Failover Scenario
- Demonstrate connection loss handling
- Show automatic switch to simulation mode
- Display continuous data flow

## 7. Future Enhancements [30-45 seconds]

### Planned Features
- Support for multiple exchanges
- Advanced data analytics implementation
- Enhanced simulation model
- Machine learning predictions
- System scaling for higher throughput

## 8. Conclusion [30 seconds]

This system demonstrates a robust approach to handling real-time market data with proper failover mechanisms and data persistence. It's built with scalability in mind and can be extended to support multiple data sources and advanced features in the future.
